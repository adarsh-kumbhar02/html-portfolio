<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, welcome to my portfolio! My name is Adarsh Kumbhar, and I am a passionate third-year Computer Engineering student from Pune. I have a strong interest in technology, problem-solving, and innovation, which motivates me to continuously learn and grow in the field of computer science.</p>

<p>I have successfully completed my diploma in Computer Engineering from Raisklal Manikchand Institute of Technology, which laid a solid foundation for my technical knowledge. Currently, I am pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (B.E.), where I am diving deeper into advanced topics and building my skills through hands-on projects and real-world applications.</p>

<p>I am actively learning C++, Data Structures and Algorithms, and web development. I believe in a growth mindset and always strive to enhance my understanding of both theoretical concepts and practical implementations. My journey in web development has been particularly exciting as I work to improve my front-end and back-end skills, aiming to become a versatile developer.</p>

<p>This portfolio is a reflection of my ongoing learning journey. So far, I have created two basic projects: the first showcases my top 3 favorite movies of all time, and the second is a creatively designed birthday invitation card. These projects represent just the beginning of my development path, and I am eager to take on more complex and impactful projects in the future.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to connecting and sharing more of my work as I continue to grow in the field of technology!</p>
